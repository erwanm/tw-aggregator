Use ~TiddlyWiki 5 to write or draw notes! Just create a new tiddler, use the field editor at the bottom of the tiddler to add a new field entitled type, then paste image/jpeg into the 'type' window. Immediately a canvas will appear, and you can adjust the canvas size to your liking. Save the tiddler and draw away!
