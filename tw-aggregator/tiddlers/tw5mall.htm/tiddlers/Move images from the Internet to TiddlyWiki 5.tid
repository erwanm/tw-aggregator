title: Move images from the Internet to TiddlyWiki 5
tags: Images

~TiddlyWiki 5 doesn't currently save web images by drag-and-drop in the same way that it does for images from your web.

We recommend dragging the image to your desktop, then dragging the image from your desktop to your ~TiddlyWiki.
