title: Icons based on tags example
tags: macros linux database [[using TW5]] snippets
source-wiki: http://braintest.tiddlyspot.com/#Icons%20based%20on%20tags%20example

This is an example of how a filter with icons based on tags looks like. The tags does not make any sense, is just to illustrate how awesome is this. As you can see, only the tags that has an icon assigned are rendered as icons.
