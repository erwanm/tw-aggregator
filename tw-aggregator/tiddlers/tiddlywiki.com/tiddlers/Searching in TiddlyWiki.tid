Searching is fast and flexible in ~TiddlyWiki. 

''Standard search''

Typing text into the search box in the sidebar will turn up a list of all the tiddlers that contain that text.

://(Note that the sidebar tabs will be hidden by the search results until you click the 'x' to the right of the search box to remove the search results)//

''Advanced searching''

Clicking on the magnifying glass icon to the right of the search box will open [[$:/AdvancedSearch]]. This tiddler contains four tabs:

* The ''standard'' tab contains another instance of the search box found in the sidebar

* The ''system'' tab allows you to limit your search to system tiddlers

* The ''shadows'' tab allows you to limit your search to shadow tiddlers

* The ''filter'' tab is not a search box, per se, but a way to obtain a list of all tiddlers that meet the specific criteria described by that filter, for example, "All tags except system tags". More information in [[Introduction to Filters]]
