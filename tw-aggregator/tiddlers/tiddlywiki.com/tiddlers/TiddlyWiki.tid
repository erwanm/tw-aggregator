~TiddlyWiki is a rich, interactive tool for manipulating complex data with structure that doesn't easily fit into conventional tools like spreadsheets or wordprocessors.

~TiddlyWiki is designed to fit around your brain, helping you deal with the things that won't fit. The [[fundamental idea|Philosophy of Tiddlers]] is that information is more useful and reusable if we cut it up into the smallest semantically meaningful chunks -- [[tiddlers|Tiddlers]] -- and give them titles so that they can be [[structured|Structuring TiddlyWiki]] with [[links|TiddlerLinks]], [[tags|Tagging]], [[lists|ListField]] and [[macros|Macros]].  Tiddlers use a WikiText notation that concisely represents a wide range of text formatting and hypertext features. ~TiddlyWiki aims to provide a fluid interface for working with tiddlers, allowing them to be aggregated and composed into longer narratives.

People [[love using|Raves]] ~TiddlyWiki. Because it can be used without any complicated server infrastructure, and because it is [[open source|OpenSource]], it has bought unprecedented freedom to people to keep their precious information under their own control. ~TiddlyWiki was originally created by JeremyRuston and is now a thriving open source project with a busy [[Community]] of independent developers.
