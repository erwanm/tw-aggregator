# Ensure you have the latest version of [[Firefox for Android]]
#* http://getfirefox.com
# Install the latest release of the TiddlyFox extension from:
#* https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tiddlyfox/
# Install this extension to be able to save the TiddlyWiki file locally:
#* https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/save-link-menus/
# [[Download]] an empty TiddlyWiki by saving this link:
#* http://tiddlywiki.com/empty.html
#> (to save the link, ensure you've installed the "save-link-menus" extension and then long-press on the link and choose "Save link")
# When the file has downloaded, click on it within the notification tray or the download manager application
# Choose to open the file in Firefox (rather than the default Android viewer)
# Click ''OK'' in response to the prompt from TiddlyFox that asks whether to enable saving for this file
# Try creating a new tiddler using the ''plus'' {{$:/core/images/new-button}} button in the sidebar. Type some content for the tiddler, and click the {{$:/core/images/done-button}} ''tick'' button
# Save your changes by clicking the {{$:/core/images/save-button}} ''download'' button in the sidebar
#* Look for the yellow notification ''Saved wiki'' at the top right of the window
