The qualify macro is part of the StateMechanism. Given a base tiddler title it generates a unique string that includes a hashed encoding of a position within the widget render tree, identified by the stack of transcluded tiddlers that leads to that position.

! Parameters

|1st |title |Base tiddler title | |

! Examples

The results returned by the qualify macro will depend upon where it is used. For example:

```
<<qualify "base">>
```

Returns:

<<qualify "base">>
