The built-in TiddlySpot saver can also be used to save changes to a simple PHP script that you can run on most hosting providers.

//These are preliminary instructions that need verification//

# Download a copy of ''store.php'' from:
#* https://code.google.com/p/bidix/source/browse/trunk/TiddlyHome/_th/lib/store.php
# Edit your copy of ''store.php'' to add your username(s) and password(s). Find the line `$USERS = array( 'UserName1'=>'Password1', etc)` and replace Username1 and Password1 with your desired username and password
#* Make sure you leave all the punctuation and code, such as the single quotes, intact
# Save the file
# Using FTP or your web interface, upload ''store.php'' to your server. Make sure that the filename is correct
#* If you've uploaded the file correctly you should be able to view it in your browser (eg, http://example.com/store.php)
# In TiddlyWiki, go to the ''Saving'' tab of the control panel and enter the following information:
#* Your username as the wiki name
#* Your password
#* The URL of the ''store.php'' file (//''not'' the URL of the wiki, this must the full URL to the ''store.php'' file//)

The control panel ''Saving'' tab includes the following configuration options:

|!Name |!Description |
|Server URL |The full URL to the ''store.php'' file on your server |
|Upload filename |The filename used to save the TiddlyWiki (defaults to ''index.html'') |
|Upload directory |The relative path from ''store.php'' to the directory used for saving the file |
|Backup directory |The relative path from ''store.php'' to the directory used for backups |
