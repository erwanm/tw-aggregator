The ''field'' filter operator filters the current list according to whether a field matches a specified value.

The operand is the value to match, and the suffix is used to identify the field. For example:

|!Filter String |!Description |
|`[field:modifier[JeremyRuston]]` |Returns a list of the tiddlers created by `JeremyRuston` |
|`[modifier[JeremyRuston]]` |Returns a list of the tiddlers created by `JeremyRuston` |

Note that if an unknown filter operator `[unknown[xxx]]` is encountered it is interpreted as `[field:unknown[xxx]]`.
