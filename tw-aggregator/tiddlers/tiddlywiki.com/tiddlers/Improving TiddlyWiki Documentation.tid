Anyone can submit improvements to the TiddlyWiki documentation that appears on http://tiddlywiki.com.

# Read and observe the [[Documentation Style Guide]]
# Create an account on https://github.com if you don't already have one
# On http://tiddlywiki.com, click "edit" on the tiddler you want to improve
# You should see a pink banner with the text: //Can you help us improve this documentation? Find out how to edit this tiddler on ~GitHub//
# Click on the external link ...''this tiddler on ~GitHub''
## You will be prompted that "you need to fork this repository to propose changes". A "fork" is your own copy of the repository that incorporates the changes you are proposing
# A new browser tab should open ready to edit the tiddler on github.com
# Below the edit box for the tiddler text you should see a box labelled ''Propose file change''
# Enter a brief title to explain the change (eg, "Clarify attribute syntax instability")
# If necessary, enter a longer description too
# Click the green button labelled ''Propose file change''
# On the following screen, click the green button labelled ''Create pull request''

[[Jermolene|https://github.com/Jermolene]] or one of the other core developers will then have the opportunity to merge your pull request so that it is incorporated into the next build of http://tiddlywiki.com.
