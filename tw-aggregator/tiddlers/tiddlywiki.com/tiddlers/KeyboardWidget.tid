! Introduction

The keyboard widget allows [[Messages]] to be generated in response to key presses.

! Content and Attributes

The content of the `<$keyboard>` widget is rendered normally. The keyboard shortcut only takes effect within the contained content.

|!Attribute |!Description |
|message |The title of the [[WidgetMessage|Messages]] to generate |
|param |The parameter to be passed with the [[WidgetMessage|Messages]] |
|key |Key string identifying the key to be trapped (see below) |
|class |A CSS class to be assigned to the generated HTML DIV element |

! Key Strings

Key strings are made up of zero or more of the modifiers ''alt'', ''shift'' or ''ctrl'' followed by the name of a key, all joined with "+" plus symbols. Key names are either the letter or digit printed on the key (eg "a" or "1"), or one of the special keys ''backspace'', ''tab'', ''enter'' or ''escape''.

For example:

```
A
shift+A
shift+escape
ctrl+enter
ctrl+shift+alt+A
```
