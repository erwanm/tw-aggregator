The ''sort'' filter operator sorts the current list case insensitively (upper and lower case letters are considered equivalent), along the field specified in the operand (which defaults to `title`). Preceding the operator with `!` reverses the sort order.

For example:

|!Filter String |!Description |
|`one two three four +[sort[]]` |Returns `four`, `one`, `three`, `two` |
|`one two Three four +[sort[]]` |Returns `four`, `one`, `Three`, `two` |

For an example of use with explicit operands, see [[FilterOperator: limit]].
