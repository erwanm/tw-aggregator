! Introduction

Safe mode provides a way to disabling most customisations in TiddlyWiki. This is useful because if TiddlyWiki is customised incorrectly it can be rendered inoperable. A particular issue is that some customisations break when upgrading to a newer core version of TiddlyWiki (especially during the beta).

! Enabling Safe Mode

Safe mode is enabled in the browser by starting TiddlyWiki with the URL hash set to the string `#:safe`. For example:

http://tiddlywiki.com/#:safe

! How Safe Mode Works

Safe mode triggers two changes:

* All plugins are temporarily disabled. You can use the control panel to disable individual plugins
* Any tiddlers that override shadow tiddlers are renamed to give them the prefix `SAFE: `, thus restoring the underlying shadow tiddler

A report tiddler is displayed that allows you to inspect the tiddlers that were renamed.
