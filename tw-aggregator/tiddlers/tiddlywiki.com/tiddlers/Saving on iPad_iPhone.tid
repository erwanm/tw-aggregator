The iPad/iPhone app ''TWEdit'' makes it possible to edit and save changes to TiddlyWiki5, including working offline without a network connection. [[Download it here|https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/twedit/id409607956?mt=8]].

Instructions for use:

# Open TWEdit
# Touch the title in the centre of the toolbar in order
#* A text box should appear allowing you to enter a URL
# Enter the URL `http://tiddlywiki.com/empty.html`
# When the empty TiddlyWiki5 has loaded, touch the ''save'' icon (it's the second icon from the right on the top toolbar)
#* An alert box should appear allowing you to enter a local filename
# Enter the filename you wish to use for the document (ending with `.html`)

# To save changes, click the ''save'' button in the sidebar
