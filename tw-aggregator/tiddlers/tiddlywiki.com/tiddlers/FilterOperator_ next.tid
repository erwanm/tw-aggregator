The ''next'' filter operator takes each tiddler in the current list and looks it up in the `list` field of the tiddler specified in the operand, and then returns the immediately following tiddler title.

The following examples assume a tiddler called `MyList` with a `list` field containing:

```
one two three four five
```

|!Filter String |!Description |
|`[[three]next[MyList]]` |Returns `four` |
|`[[five]next[MyList]]` |Returns an empty list |
|`one three +[next[MyList]]` |Returns `two`, `four` |
