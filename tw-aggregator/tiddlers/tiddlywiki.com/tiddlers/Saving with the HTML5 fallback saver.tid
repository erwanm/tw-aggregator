This method of saving changes is clunky because it requires manual intervention for each save. It has the advantage of working on almost all desktop browsers, and many mobile browsers.

# [[Download]] an empty TiddlyWiki by clicking this button:
#> {{$:/editions/tw5.com/snippets/download-empty-button}}
#> If the button doesn't work save this link: http://tiddlywiki.com/empty.html
#> Your browser may ask you to accept the download before it begins
# Locate the file you just downloaded
#* You may rename it, but be sure to keep the `.html` or `.htm` extension
# Open the file in your browser
# Try creating a new tiddler using the ''new tiddler'' {{$:/core/images/new-button}} button in the sidebar. Type some content for the tiddler, and click the {{$:/core/images/done-button}} ''done'' button
# Save your changes by clicking the {{$:/core/images/save-button}} ''save changes'' button in the sidebar
# Your browser will download a new copy of the wiki incorporating your changes
# Locate the newly downloaded file and open it in your browser
# Verify that your changes have been saved correctly

''Tip'': most browsers have an option to prompt each time for the download location. This allows you to select the existing version of the file and replace it.
