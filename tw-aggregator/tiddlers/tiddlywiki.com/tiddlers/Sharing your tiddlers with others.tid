There are a number of ways that people can share tiddlers back and forth:

*You can attach a ~TiddlyWiki to an e-mail
*You can publish your ~TiddlyWiki online, and grab a link to send or message to others:
**A link to the URL of the file itself
**A permalink to a specific tiddler (see [[PermaLinks]])
**A permaview link of all the currently open tiddlers (see [[PermaView]])
*You can grab tiddlers from ~TiddlyWikis that others have published online by clicking on a link to the tiddler within their file, and then dragging and dropping the link into your own file. An import tiddler will appear, and you can click to import the tiddler or tiddlers to your file.
* You can [[share a Dropbox link to your TiddlyWiki|Sharing a TiddlyWiki on Dropbox]]
