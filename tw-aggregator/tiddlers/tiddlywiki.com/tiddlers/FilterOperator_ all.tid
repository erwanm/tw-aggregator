The ''all'' filter operator is used to select combinations of lists of tiddlers for subsequent operations.

The operand of the ''all'' operator is a list of names of tiddler sources joined with `+`.

For example:

|!Filter String |!Description |
|`[all[tiddlers]]` |Selects all 'real' tiddlers (both system and non-system), excluding shadow tiddlers |
|`[all[shadows]]` |Selects all ShadowTiddlers, including those that have been overridden with real tiddlers |
|`[all[shadows+tiddlers]]` |Selects all ShadowTiddlers and all 'real' tiddlers together |
|`[all[current]]` |Selects the current tiddler |
|`[all[missing]]` |Selects all MissingTiddlers |
|`[all[orphans]]` |Selects all OrphanTiddlers |
|`[all[]]` |Selects all the source tiddlers available to the filter |
