This method of saving changes is clunky because it requires manual intervention for each save.

# [[Download]] an empty TiddlyWiki by clicking this button:
#> {{$:/editions/tw5.com/snippets/download-empty-button}}
#> If the button doesn't work save this link: http://tiddlywiki.com/empty.html
#> Your browser may ask you to accept the download before it begins
# Locate the file you just downloaded
#* You may rename it, but be sure to keep the `.html` or `.htm` extension
# Open the file in Safari
# Try creating a new tiddler using the ''new tiddler'' {{$:/core/images/new-button}} button in the sidebar. Type some content for the tiddler, and click the {{$:/core/images/done-button}} ''done'' button
# Save your changes by clicking the {{$:/core/images/save-button}} ''save changes'' button in the sidebar
# A popup "Download changes" window is displayed that includes a link labelled //Right-click to save changes//
# Right-click on the link and select "Download Linked File As..." from the popup menu
# Navigate to the folder containing your wiki HTML file and select the existing file
# Click the "Save" button
# Click "Replace" to confirm replacing the existing file
# Verify that your changes have been saved correctly
