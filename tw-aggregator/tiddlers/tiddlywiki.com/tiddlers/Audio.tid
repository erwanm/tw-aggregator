Audio files can be incorporated into TiddlyWiki in a very similar way to [[images|Images in WikiText]].

! Embedded Audio

Small audio files can be embedded directly within TiddlyWiki. Embedding isn't suitable for large files (over a few hundred kilobytes) because it increases the size of the TiddlyWiki file.

For example, the tiddler [[TiddlyWiki.mp3]] contains an MP3 recording of the word "TiddlyWiki". Viewing the tiddler directly should show an audio player that allows playback.

You can also transclude audio files. For example:

<<wikitext-example-without-html '{{TiddlyWiki.mp3}}'>>

! External Audio

External audio tiddlers use the ''_canonical_uri'' field to point to an external audio file/stream, and have a block ''text'' field. This reduces their size considerably, and still allows for playback.

For example, the tiddler [[Caruso - Ave Maria]] points to an online audio recording hosted on http://archive.org:

<<wikitext-example-without-html '{{Caruso - Ave Maria}}'>>
