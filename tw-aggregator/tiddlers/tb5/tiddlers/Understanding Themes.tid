From a very [[informative post|https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tiddlywikidev/DHzU_kYhkl4/o4BgMTwF_f0J]] by [[Jeremy|Jeremy Ruston]] on how theme switching actually works...

# themes are <<tw Plugins>>
#* thus bundles of packaged tiddlers loaded as <<tw ShadowTiddlers>>
# when the theme is switched
#* the old theme and its shadows is entirely unloaded
#* the new theme and its containing shadow tiddlers are loaded
# when you edit a shadow tiddler of a theme
#* you make it into an ordinary tiddler
#* at that point, it is no longer unloaded when switching themes!
# do you want to access the content of a theme that is not switched?
#* use the subtiddler attribute of the <<tw ViewWidget>> or <<tw TranscludeWidget>>
