With [[version 5.1.5|http://tiddlywiki.com/prerelease/]] conditionally rendering content will be much simplified as it is no longer required for the reveal widget to match against the value stored in a state tiddler, but rather to compare against a default value.

This essentially allows to conditionally render contents by comparing evaluated parameters, variables or constants against one another.

!!Example
The below example will render the output when the day defined in the variable `day`, here examplarily set to `Saturday`, matches the current day...

```
<$set name="day" value="Wednesday">
<$reveal type="match" default=<<day>> text=<<dateTime "DDD">>>
Hooray, it's <<day>>!
</$reveal>
<$reveal type="nomatch" default=<<day>> text=<<dateTime "DDD">>>
Nope, it's <<dateTime "DDD">>, so not <<day>> just yet.
</$reveal>
</$set>
```

<<<
<$set name="day" value="Wednesday">
<$reveal type="match" default=<<day>> text=<<dateTime "DDD">>>
Hooray, it's <<day>>!
</$reveal>
<$reveal type="nomatch" default=<<day>> text=<<dateTime "DDD">>>
Nope, it's <<dateTime "DDD">>, so not <<day>> just yet.
</$reveal>
</$set>
