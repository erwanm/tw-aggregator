The Third Flow plugin brings to you another way to develop customizations for TiddlyWiki 5. It is not enforcing a specific development flow, it simply tries to help you. Otherwise, it tries to stay out of your way.

----

You can develop your plugin directly from within your browser. A server-based TiddlyWiki instance running on Node.js ensures that all your source tiddlers are neatly stored in a clean and hierarchically organized folder structure.

Source code management is done as usual using your favorite source code management tool, such as git and others. As the Third Flow plugin structures your tiddler source files you get a well-organized repository structure at no price.

For packaging your plugin you finally simply run a shell script which packs the plugin tiddler and saves it to disk. Additionally, a demonstration TiddlyWiki is also created that guides your future plugin users through the process of deploying your new plugin.
