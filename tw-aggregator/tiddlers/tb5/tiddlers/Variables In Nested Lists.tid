An [[overview|https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/tiddlywiki/1BjhyWKpTgg]] from [[Danielo Rodríguez]] on working with variables in nested list widgets.

The list widget has a powerful feature, the variable parameter. It helps you in not losing the reference to the parent while providing meaningful variables names within lists:

```
<$list filter="[tag[sometag]]" variable="item">
both still reference the parent: {{!!title}}, <<currentTiddler>>
the more obvious list item now is: <<item>>

Go as deep as you want...
<$list filter="[tag<item>]" variable="subitem">
still the outermost parent: {{!!title}}, <<currentTiddler>>
1st level items: <<item>>
2nd level items: <<subitem>>
</$list>

</$list>
```

Notice the single angle brackets with `<item>` in the filter expression of the inner list.

You can even use list variables in macro calls like so...

```
\define myItem() item name is $(item)$

<$list filter="[tag[Plugins]]" variable="item" >
<<myItem>>
</$list>
```
