In a [[reply to Rich|https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tiddlywiki/hr75FTeEL_g/Zq9c1OJz6KkJ]], [[Stephan Hradek]] posted two solutions about byte-sizes...

# a [[length|https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tiddlywiki/hr75FTeEL_g/Zq9c1OJz6KkJ]] macro to determine the size of any text or tiddler
# the [[lsort|https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tiddlywiki/hr75FTeEL_g/tFQ-ZIQoMLwJ]] filter that allows to sort tiddlers by size

An example and install instructions are at [[length macro and lsort filter @ tbdemo|http://tbdemo.tiddlyspot.com/#length%20macro%20and%20lsort%20filter]].

''Note:'' When you create both in your wiki, be sure to set the `title`, `type` and `module-type` fields accordingly.

Here's how to use both to list tiddlers by size along with size information:

```
<$list filter="[!lsort[]]">

<$macrocall $name="length" tiddler={{!!title}}/>
<$link><$view field=title/></$link>
</$list>
```

!!Alternative

To get a quick output from your browser console, you can try this bit of code:
