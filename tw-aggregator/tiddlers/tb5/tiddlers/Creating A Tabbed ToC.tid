With version 5.1.5 TiddlyWiki is now [[capable of rendering a vertically tabbed toc|http://tiddlywiki.com/#TableOfContentsMacro%20Tabbed%20Example]] which should come in very handy for documentation projects, control panels, etc...

Here's an example markup:

```
<<toc-tabbed-internal-nav
tag:GettingStarted
selectedTiddler:"$:/temp/tb5-tabbed-toc-example"
unselectedText:"Select a topic in the table of contents to the left.<br>Click the arrows to expand topics."
template:"$:/.tb/templates/tabbed-toc-example">>
```

This renders a tabbed table of contents with the tiddlers tagging to [[GettingStarted]] being the main topics.

The state of this example toc, i.e. the currently selected tab, is stored in the field ''state'' of a system tiddler called `$:/temp/tb5-tabbed-toc-example`.

''Note:'' As of 5.1.5 the ability to define a custom template for the actual contents is missing yet. This is now fixed in [[5.1.6 prerelease|http://tiddlywiki.com/prerelease/#%24%3A%2Fcore%2Fmacros%2Ftoc]] ([[1|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/commit/b220c19fb7b789eb6d00c9d1a71414676d87130e]], [[2|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/commit/1e7d9bd3cd17be006b035ada8e45f83f154e61e9]]), which is why you can see it in use here since I already imported the updated macro. If you should import that into your wiki, as well, make sure to remove it again after [[upgrading to 5.1.6|Cleanup 5.1.6]].

Here's the above toc generated:

<<toc-tabbed-internal-nav
tag:GettingStarted
selectedTiddler: "$:/temp/tb5-tabbed-toc-exampleX"
unselectedText: "Select a topic in the table of contents to the left.<br>Click the arrows to expand topics. "
template:"$:/.tb/templates/tabbed-toc-example">>
