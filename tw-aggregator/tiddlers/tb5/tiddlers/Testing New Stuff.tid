It's really trivial and so powerful, indeed.

Ever wanted to just test something but not screw up your wiki?

Simply go to http://tiddlywiki.com and work your magic over there!

Unless you need to reload the page, e.g. by installing a plugin, you can pretty much experiment on a whole range of things with live content, e.g. drag your test content to it and test editing over there to your heart's content.

Are you happy with the results? Well, then grab that link and pull it back to your TiddlyWiki.

When was the last time you visited a website that allowed you to do just that?!

Find something to be off? Then check out this [[simple documentation workflow|Documentation]] on how easy it is to make things better for the rest of us.
