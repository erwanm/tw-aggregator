title: Adding A ColorPicker For Editing Images

source-wiki: http://tb5.tiddlyspot.com#Adding%20A%20ColorPicker%20For%20Editing%20Images

A trick inspired by [[Jeremy's comment|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/issues/911#issuecomment-56985742]]: Always wanted to change that default @@color:#ffff00;background:#bbb;padding:3px 5px;border-radius:7px;yellow@@ used for painting over images?

Just as you can add a [[Conditional ViewTemplate Section]], you can add a custom edit template component by tagging it [[$:/tags/EditTemplate]].

Simply drag this template to your TiddlyWiki and for all your image tiddlers a color-picker and a setting for the line-width will be displayed right below the image dimensions: <<source $:/.tb/ui/EditTemplate/paint>>

Try it out editing and see if you can manage to play with opacity, as well...
