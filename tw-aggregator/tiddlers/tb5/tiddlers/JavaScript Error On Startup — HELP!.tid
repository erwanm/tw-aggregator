Ok, it happens. We install some plugin, fiddle with a core component and then we reload and see that dreaded @@color:white;background:#f33;padding:3px 5px;border-radius:5px;~JavaScript Error@@.

What to do now?

!! 1. Testing Plugins And Modifications

First things first. If you have your TiddlyWiki to update the URL whenever a tiddler opens, try opening a different tiddler first and see if the error is still around. It could be that you are testing a faulty plugin in a tiddler and that only your test tiddler throws the error. Go to the plugin, edit your modifications or delete it, save, reload.

!! 2. Safe Mode

If that does not allow you to remove the offending bits, try loading your TiddlyWiki in safe-mode by appending `#:safe` to the url of your wiki.

This should disable all plugins amongst others and allows you to edit or delete whatever you suspect the culprit to be. Reaload without safe-mode and see if the error is gone.

!! 3. Import Into Empty

If all else fails, try downloading an empty TiddlyWiki and drag-n-drop your broken file onto it so as to import all tiddlers while unchecking any of those you suspect to have broken your wiki.

Save and reload. Is it finally back up now?
