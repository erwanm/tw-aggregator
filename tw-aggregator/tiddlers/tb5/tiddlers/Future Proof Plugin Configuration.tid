Are you using a plugin in your tw5 or tw5 based application and need to make adjustments to the plugin? Are you including plugins into your edition on node.js, e.g. [[doing translations|Translate TW5]]?

If you are, [[I suggest|https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tiddlywiki/ZRKmb-TwbkM/HAvwof9oZbEJ]] you do not overwrite plugin components directly, i.e. code tiddlers, but rather implement your own customization overwriting them.

This way, you ensure that plugin updates are still delivered to your wiki later and are perhaps readily usable within your wiki.

If a plugin is not sufficiently configurable it is advisable to suggest customization enhancements to the plugin author.

For example, for `$:/plugins/tiddlywiki/tw2parser` you could create an override `$:/plugins/tiddlywiki/tw2parser/my-project-config` leaving the original untouched while overriding components provided by the plugin.
