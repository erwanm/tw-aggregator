Sparked from [[this issue|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/issues/948#issuecomment-64797341]], here's a way to ensure your visitors find their way to the new tiddler using old links, in case you ever decide renaming them...

!! Installation

You can simply drag these two to your wiki and start right away:

* [[$:/config/Redirected]] — edit redirects here, see below
* [[$:/template/redirected]]

!! Step 1 — define redirects

To define redirects, create a [[DataTiddler|http://tiddlywiki.com/#DataTiddlers]] of type `application/json` and feed it with proper JSON formating like <<source $:/config/Redirected>>

Here the index to the left will be your old title and the index to the right contains either a link or full-blown wiki-text to inform the user of what's changed.

!! Step 2 — conditional template

As explained before, you can create [[a conditional view-template section|Conditional ViewTemplate Section]] which displays information when certain conditions are met.

Here's one that displays a redirect message at the top of a tiddler...

<<source [[$:/template/redirected]]>>

The template is displayed at the top of each indexed tiddler because...

# it is tagged [[$:/tags/ViewTemplate]]
# has the field `list-before` set to [[$:/core/ui/ViewTemplate/body]] which tells the renderer to place it before the tiddler body

!! Step 3 — styles

Using the `redirected` class as defined in the template above, you can either add styles directly to the template or use a [[custom stylesheet|Custom Stylesheets]].
