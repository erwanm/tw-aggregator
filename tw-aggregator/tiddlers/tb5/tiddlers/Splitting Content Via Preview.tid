A worklflow [[proposed by Alex Hough|https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/tiddlywiki/Xz2lSXXy0iU]]...

Here's how you can split long content while editing...

# remove relevant textbits from the editor and put it in the new tiddler
# enable the preview pane
# create link
# click link in preview to create new tiddler
# paste textbits into new tiddler

''Tip:'' turn comma separated lists in the text into bullet points.
