Reviews of the ticklers are conducted periodically â€“ generally at some convenient time, once per week. During the review, tasks are cleared from the inbox, turned into ticklers by identifying the 'next action' and placed into appropriate tickler folders. Ticklers in approaching time-slots are re-posted into tickler folders for the forthcoming week, and tagged with the relevant context(s).
