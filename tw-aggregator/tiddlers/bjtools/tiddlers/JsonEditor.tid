Try editing these examples: [[A menu system]] [[Employee data]].
Note that on keypress updating is disabled as a default, there is a 'set value' button that is used to enter values. The default can be changed by editing the option file:[[$:/plugins/bj/jsoneditor/options.json]]. On keypress updating may be slow due to the editor compiling the json.
