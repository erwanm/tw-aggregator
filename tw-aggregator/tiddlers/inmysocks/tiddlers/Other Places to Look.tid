source-wiki: http://inmysocks.tiddlyspot.com/#Other%20Places%20to%20Look

Much of the content of this wiki was borrowed or derived from these other excellent sources:

*http://www.tiddlywiki.com - The tiddlywiki page. If you managed to get here without knowing about it I am a bit impressed.
*http://tw5magick.tiddlyspot.com/ - a good collection of tips, the start of the contacts example from here.
*http://tiddlystuff.tiddlyspot.com/ - I don't know if i borrowed any of the content from here, but it was a good resource for learning
*https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tiddlywiki - the tiddlywiki google group. The people there are very helpful, and generally pretty fast answering questions.
*http://braintest.tiddlyspot.com/ - The hoverwidget comes from here, as well as some other examples.
*http://thediveo.github.io/TW5FontAwesome/output/fontawesome.html# - the font awesome plugin
*http://tb5.tiddlyspot.com/#GettingStarted - Probably the most comprehensive reference for how to do things in tiddlywiki. It is set up as more of a reference than a tutorial, so it may be more helpful once you understand tiddlywiki a bit. Then it is one of the most useful places to look. The listed resources here ( http://tb5.tiddlyspot.com/#References ) cover just about everything that people have worked out how to do with TiddlyWiki (publicly anyway), so looking there is probably more useful than looking at this list. 

I am certain that there are other sources that I have forgotten. I will add more as I find or remember them.

If you know of a good resource I should add or see that I copied something and missed giving proper credit please email me at inmysocks (at) gmail (dot) com. There are many very good resources and I would like to make sure that everyone gets credit for their work.

If you have questions that aren't specifically about this reference you should probably post to the google group since they will almost certainly be more helpful and quicker to answer than I would be.
