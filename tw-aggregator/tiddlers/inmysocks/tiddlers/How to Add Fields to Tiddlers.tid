A `field` is a generic attribute that can be added to any tiddler. They consist of a name and a string of text. They can have many uses for things like filtering, and they are used for many of the hover macros (like [[Make an image tiddlers blurb field show up like a tooltip]]).

To add a field start editing a tiddler and at the bottom there should be a line that says `Add a new field:` with an input box next to it. Type the name of the field you want to add and click on the `add` button next to it. Then the field will be listed with an input box next to it. Whatever is in that box is the contents of the field.

If you edit this tiddler you will see that it has the field `blurb` with the contents `Adding fields is useful`.
