@@.brown ''Introduction''@@

I am a longtime user of ~TiddlyWiki Classic and still use it daily since you can't do everything in ~TiddlyWiki 5 (yet) ;-)

I started experimenting with TW5 at the end of September 2013 (alpha10).<br>
Since I missed a few things in the layout I got used to in ~TiddlyWiki Classic ^^1^^, I started with modifying the layout of TW5.<br>
To share my knowledge, I made a few guides about these 'modifications'.<br>
The guides started as a non-linear personal web notebook (yeah, the subtitle of ~TiddlyWiki!). I started experimenting with layout things and used TW5 to document my experiments.
