Lost yet ? Lesseeâ€¦

Here are a few of the things you could do / build using TiddlyWiki :

* A dynamic notepad for research / study
* A blog, with TW as notepad and editor, and even as publishing platform.
* A shared //smart// cookbook, with built-in timers and grocery list generator.
* A project management and planner tool, for you and collaborators.
* Create ebooks that can be read on anything with a half decent browser, free of DRM and complete with annotations and dynamic updates.
* A wiki, because why not ?

Depending on adding plugins and modules, and on whether your TW runs from a single html file on a USB key or is hosted and runs as a server, there is little that can't be done.
Fresh out of the box, TW allows you to do something like what you're [[reading now|aboot]]. 

Of course, knowing you can doesn't magically let you know how to, so let's take it from the top and start with the basics, like [[what's a tiddler, anyway ?|I am a Tiddler]]
