Some things in TiddlyWiki seem like [[Magic]]. As my preferred nick is [[Skeeve|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MythAdventures]], I felt that TW5 Magick is a proper name for this collection of some of the "magic" tricks one can do with TiddlyWiki.

This collection was created while working with TiddlyWiki 5, reading the [[TiddlyWiki Google Group|https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tiddlywiki]] and the [[TiddlyWikiDev Group|https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tiddlywikidev]] and trying to solve problems presented there.

The tricks presented here are mostly possible with the bare TiddlyWiki 5 without applying any plugins, tweaks or patches.

But there is also a place, where I collected some plugins and macros for TiddlyWiki 5: [[TiddlyStuff|http://tiddlystuff.tiddlyspot.com]].
